# Applied Cryptography project seminar

This is a skeleton repository for Applied cryptography project seminar. This
repository was created with the intention that students applying the course
will manage their assignments as separate branches of this repo.

## Getting started
1. Login or create your GitHub account.
2. Make a fork of this project. (You can find a button for it on GitHub UI.)
3. Clone the project from your own account 
   ``git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/applied-cryptography-project-seminar``
4. Create your own branch and switch to that branch
   ``git branch create <your neptun id>``
   ``git switch <your neptun id>``
5. Work on the project and update your changes to your GitHub repository.
6. Create pull request on GitHub UI when you want me to check your work (I will
   do that periodically anyway if your repo public.)

## Structure to follow
There are a few (empty) directories created that should contain different part
of your project.
- `materials`: This directory should contain the papers and other stuff that
  your project is based on. It is also fine to create a file in this directory 
  that contain references and links.
- `doc`: Your documentation should go here except that you can also edit the
  main `README.md` file. There is a directory for the end semester presentation
  too.
- `src`: Your source code should be in this directory.
